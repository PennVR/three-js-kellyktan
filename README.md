Here is a link to a demo: https://pennvr.github.io/three-js-kellyktan/

To generate the terrain, I implemented the Perlin Noise algorithm and applied it to the coordinates of my plane to generate the heights.  I scaled the noise with the distance from the center to give the user a feeling of being in the middle of a valley.  To produce fireworks, I used a sphere to represent the rocket and a string of particles to represent the explosion and fallout.  I applied gravity to each component of the fireworks gravity to give them a realistic appearance.
